A student at üë®‚Äçüíª Aalto University, pursuing a Masters degree in Autonomous Systems. I am an automation enthusiast working with many projects related to Robotics and AI.
  
## Projects

### Connected Vehicle Platooning
 - Developing ROS packages for robot communication and multi robot controllers for predecessor following vehicle platoons.
 - Analysis of stability of semi-autonomous platoons.

### Sensor Fusion for Autonomous Robot Tracking 
 - Developed an algorithm for tracking an autonomous robot by using sensor data from the IMU and camera system.

### Autonomous Self-Parking Vehicle [[Video](https://youtu.be/YkTl6Fsfp7o)]
 - Used OpenCV & Tensorflow with YOLOv3 for processing camera images to detect objects, lanes & traffic signs.
 - Developed a custom-designed path-planning algorithm for road navigation. Implemented using ROS framework and MORSE simulator.

### Moving Ball Deflector - Robotic Arm System [[Github](https://github.com/niladut/robotics-ball-deflector) | [Video](https://youtu.be/Dgt2PGqyBls)]
 - AI & Robotics Systems Project

### Driverless Formula Race Car - Mapping System [[Website](https://fasttube.de)]
 - Developed a computer-vision algorithm to cone detection and mapping system with OpenCV & Tensorflow for FaSTTUBe TU Berlin's Formula Student Driverless Vehicle Team.

### Lunar Rover - Electrical System Design 
 - Worked on the electrical team for the development of a Lunar Rover prototype design with navigation and telemetry.

### Indoor UAV Localization for Industrial Chimney Inspection
 - Developed an indoor localization system for a UAV to navigate inside industrial chimneys for structural inspection.
 - Localisation system used Arduino with ultrasonic rangefinders, LiDAR and image processing on OpenCV.
